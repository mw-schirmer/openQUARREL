check on topmodel delay
#`BasinInfo_CHFO-0150_dhm_25_l2` <- readRDS("E:/hydroens_droughtch/data/leaflet_downloads/20250626/meteo_leaflet/BasinInfo_CHFO-0150_dhm_25_l2.rds")
# input$delay <- `BasinInfo_CHFO-0150_dhm_25_l2`$delayFunction
# input$topidx <- `BasinInfo_CHFO-0150_dhm_25_l2`$topidxClasses
works because of partial matching
See if there is output on vilan for topmodel, as there are the old basin infos without these fields!!!


include snow module

describe all models

explain calibration options

create vignettes(1 minimalistic, snow modules, calibration_methods, putting all together)

data from camels

installation instruction, check also dependencies with other packages, explain how to get hydromad ...
check on airGR version, especially as one function is not available in newer updates. ask authors or write a wrapper

check snow output for hydromad

include cal_par as input

settings, default_cal_par as data set

Warnung: The vignette title specified in \VignetteIndexEntry{} is different from the title in the YAML metadata. The former is "run_model_minimalistic", and the latter is "Run a hydrological model (minimalistic example)". If that is intentional, you may set options(rmarkdown.html_vignette.check_title = FALSE) to suppress this check.

create_input could be integrated in simulate_model, but has some downsides maybe (simulating over many parameters)

check redundancy at input airgr
