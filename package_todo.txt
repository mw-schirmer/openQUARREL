check on topmodel delay

works because of partial matching
See if there is output on vilan for topmodel, as there are the old basin infos without these fields!!!

create vignettes(1 minimalistic, snow modules, calibration_methods, putting all together)

data from camels

newer versions of airGR and hydromad: ask authors or write a wrapper

check snow output for hydromad

include cal_par as input

settings, default_cal_par as data set

Fehler in fetch(key) : 
  lazy-load database 'C:/Users/schirmer/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2/ensemblehydromodel/help/ensemblehydromodel.rdb' is corrupt


Warnung: The vignette title specified in \VignetteIndexEntry{} is different from the title in the YAML metadata. The former is "run_model_minimalistic", and the latter is "Run a hydrological model (minimalistic example)". If that is intentional, you may set options(rmarkdown.html_vignette.check_title = FALSE) to suppress this check.

create_input could be integrated in simulate_model, but has some downsides maybe (simulating over many parameters)

check redundancy at input airgr

basin_info with topmodel information

explain runoff transformations
