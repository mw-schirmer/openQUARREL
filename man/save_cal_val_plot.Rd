\title{Save Calibration and Validation Plot}
\usage{
save_cal_val_plot(file, BasinObs, Qsim, split_indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A string specifying the filename for the saved plot (e.g., \code{"cal_val.pdf"}).}

\item{BasinObs}{A data frame containing observed runoff and corresponding dates, typically from
\code{\link{load_meteo_data}}. Must include columns \code{Qmm} and \code{DatesR}.}

\item{Qsim}{A numeric vector of simulated runoff values.}

\item{split_indices}{A list of indices from \code{\link{split_data_set}}, containing elements
\code{ind_cal} and \code{ind_val} for calibration and validation periods, respectively.}
}
\value{
A logical value indicating whether the plot was successfully saved.
}
\description{
Creates and saves a plot comparing observed and simulated runoff over the calibration and validation periods.
The plot includes performance metrics such as KGE, NSE, and percent bias, and displays them for each period.
}
\details{
The function generates a two-panel plot showing observed and simulated runoff for both calibration
and validation periods. It also computes and displays selected validation metrics using
\code{\link{calc_validation_results}}. The metrics are shown as annotations on the plot.
}
\note{
Future improvements could include adding a seasonal rolling mean to the plot.
