\title{Min-Max Normalization and Re-Transformation}
\usage{
norm_minmax(x, min, max, direction = "RT")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, matrix, or array to be scaled or re-transformed.}

\item{min}{The minimum value used for scaling. Required for both directions,
but typically set to \code{min(x)} when \code{direction = "RT"}.}

\item{max}{The maximum value used for scaling. Required for both directions,
but typically set to \code{max(x)} when \code{direction = "RT"}.}

\item{direction}{A character string indicating the direction of transformation:
\code{"RT"} (real to transformed) for normalization, or \code{"TR"} (transformed to real)
for re-scaling. Default is \code{"RT"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric object of the same shape as \code{x}, either normalized or
}
\description{
Scales numeric data to the [0, 1] range using min-max normalization, or
re-transforms normalized data back to its original scale. The behavior depends
on the specified direction.
